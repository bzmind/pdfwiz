# PDFWIZ 🧙‍♂️
<h2>the best online pdf reader in the world</h2>

This is the first project that I made while learning JavaScript.</br>
So, it has TONS of bugs. The code is written in the most noobish way</br>
that exists in this universe, and it really got to a point where I couldn't</br>
fix its bugs or develop it anymore 😂</br>
Overall, it works! (and that's what's important for us, isn't it?)</br>
But I'll definitely build a new one, in a cleaner way.</br>
Because I pretty much use it EVERY SINGLE DAY to read my own PDFs, Hope you use it too!</br>
